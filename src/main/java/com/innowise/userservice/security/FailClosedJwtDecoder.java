/**
 * Makes every failure of the decoder a rejected token.
 *
 * <p>Spring Security separates two kinds of failure. A {@link BadJwtException} means that the
 * token is wrong, and the resource server answers 401. Any other {@link JwtException} means that
 * the token could not be checked, for example because the key set of the Authentication Service
 * cannot be fetched or the rate limit of the key source was reached. The resource server turns
 * that into an {@code AuthenticationServiceException}, which its filter rethrows, and the client
 * gets a 500 with a stack trace in the log.
 *
 * <p>This service has no reason to treat the two differently: a token that cannot be checked is
 * not accepted, and the client gets the same 401 as for a wrong token. The failure is logged as a
 * warning with the class names only, because the messages of the underlying exceptions contain
 * the address of the key set. Other exceptions are not caught: they are bugs and stay visible as
 * a 500.
